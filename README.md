1.    Consider   the   following   production   function   for   human   capital
h(Sj, Qj )   = Qj exp   (μjS j )
where Sj is the years of schooling in country j, Qj is quality of schooling in country j.
To   carry   out   development   accounting   we   need   an   estimate   of   human   capital.      We   have   sample   of migrants   from   a   number   of countries   working   in   the   US. We   also have   sampleof workers for the   same countries working in their home country.   The   samples   of workers   working   in   the   US   and   working   at   home   consist   of   different   workers.      The   information   about   each   worker   in   the   samples   include   wages,   years   of   schooling   and   a   set   of   wage   relevant characteristics.   However, we do not observe school quality in country j, Qj.
(a)    [12 MARKS]    To   construct   human   capital   we   need   to   estimate   the   returns   to   years schooling,   μj.      Explain   why   it   is   crucial   for   estimating   the   returns   to   schooling   to   assume that different types   of human capital   are   perfect   substitutes   in   the   production   function.
(b)    [12 MARKS]    How   do   we   estimate   on   the   data   the   returns   to   years   of   schooling?
(c)    [12 MARKS]    Suppose   we   want   estimate   the   return   to   years   of   schooling   on   all   of   our samples.   How   μj can be linked to the above production   function for human capital?
(d)    [14 MARKS]    What   can   be   learn   from   (c) about   the   estimation   of Qj?   Is   代 写ECON33001 MACROECONOMICS OF DEVELOPMENT Semester One, 2024Python

2.    Consider   a   two–sector   version   of   the   growth   model   with   agricultural   and   manufactured   goods.       Time   is   discrete   and   runs   forever   and   there   is   a   continuum   of   measure   one   of   identical households.   The utility function is given by

where the consumption aggregator is

and   µ and   C¯ are   positive   constants.   The   production   functions   for   agricultural   and   manufac-
tured goods take the form.

where T =   1 island, Lat + Lmt =   1 is   total   labor, and At is   total   factor   productivity. At grows at   a   constant   factor   γ   >   1.
(a)    [12 MARKS]    Argue   that A0    >C¯ is   a   necessary   condition   for   an   interior   equilibrium, thus, an equilibrium with positive employment in both sectors.
(b)    [12 MARKS]    Derive   the   equilibrium   conditions, and   show   that   along   the   equilibrium   path,   laboris   reallocated   from   agriculture   to   manufacturing   (“structural   transforma-tion”).    Provide   intuition   for   why   structural   transformation   takes   place   in   this   econ-   omy. 
(c)    [12 MARKS]    Show   that   the   growth   rate   of   real   GDP, Yt = Pt Cat + Cmt ,   is   increasing over   time.   Provide   the   intuition   for   why   that   is   the   case. 
(d)    [14 MARKS]    Land   owners   are   often   opposed   to   structural   transformation.    Suggest how   to   modify   this   model   so   that   it   can   be   used   to   provide   an   explanation   for   their   opposition.
